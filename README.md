<h1>Fake News Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms<h1>

<h4>This Project is to solve the problem with fake news. With the vast quantity of fake news after the advent of social media, it is easy to mislead people and influence public opinion. Fake news holds power to sway election votes and results in oneâ€™s favor. Thus, it is all the more necessary to curb such instances. The dataset contains attributes like news id, news author, news title, news article text, and fake label to mark the dubious articles as fake.
In this I have used this dataset named "Fake News" from Kaggle. You can download the file from here https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/data. I have used Logistic Regression in the project to detect fake news.<h4>
